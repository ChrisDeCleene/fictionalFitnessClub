# Fictional Fitness Club
> The focus of this project was to create a website for a fictional fitness club homepage uing the CSS Flexbox layout. The use of flexbox and a little responsive CSS creates a seemless look on all devices. I built this as part of the Full Stack Engineer Career Path on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn). Please share any feedback regarding this project! Happy coding!
